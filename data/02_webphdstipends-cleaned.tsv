Basic health insurance provided but no dental care. <span class=\"\"truncated\"\"> Dental care is an addtional $8/paycheck ($16/month). Taxes make a bigger dent in the paycheck (federal + state tax deductions). It is very possible to live along but the savings would be more than twice if living with a roommate. The rent for a 2BR is roughly 140% that of a 1BR (some 2BR&#39;s are running ~$800-$1000 whereas some 1BR&#39;s are running around $595-$750). I am not sure about other departments but summer funding for our department is mainly RAship, thus, not guaranteed. The  good thing is that the minimum stipend increases to $2000 for the 2017-2018 academic year.</span>"	NA	"$17,100"	NA	"$876"	"Iowa State University"	"Ames, IA"	"Ames, IA"	121	33113.6	12875.2	0	0
