# Stipends

Here are the publicly-made available data from the 2022-2023 USC stipend survey results.
Some basic webscraping tools are in here to get data from [the phdstipends project](https://www.phdstipends.com/). Much of the work has been supproted by the USC GSA and Graduate School. Several people have contributed and much of these efforts would not have been possible without the work of Shelly Gaynor and the PhD Stipends team.
